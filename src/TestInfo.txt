Testing used the Following cases:

{
int i
i = 1
x = 10
}$

{while (1+"  ab " != (false == x)) {}}$

{int i i=1+1+1+1}$

int i$

{}$

{$

}$

{print(1+2+3+a)}$

{
/* what about comments */
string b
}$

Results:
test1 - Worked as expected, no difficulties
test2 - Worked, this one pointed out a bug I had in the IntExpr
test3 - Worked
test4 - Fails as expected
test5 - Worked
test6 - Fails, failed surprisingly well
test7 - Fails, Pointed out a error catching bug where I didn't catch errors that happened before things began decending the trees
