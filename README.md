# SAD Compiler
A wonderful completely bug free compiler made for Alan Labouseur's CMPT 432 class, named the Symbol Analyzing Derivative

## Branches
This repository will contain a branch for each project for the class. I will later merge the branches into the master and then once the class is finished the compiler will be one single master containing the entire compiler.

## Testing/Grading
To run a file through the compiler there is a file called "Compiler Tester" located in the src folder. Run that file and it will prompt for verbose mode, and then for a file location or will allow for sysin depending on which method is not commented out. Use stdInRead() for stdin, and readFromFileTest() to use the text mode. :+1:
