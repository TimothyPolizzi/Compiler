# SAD Compiler
A wonderful completely bug free compiler made for Alan Labouseur's CMPT 432 class, named the Symbol Analyzing Derivative

## Branches
This repository will contain a branch for each project for the class. I will later merge the branches into the master and then once the class is finished the compiler will be one single master containing the entire compiler.
